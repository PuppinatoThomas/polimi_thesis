Of course. Data cleaning is a critical and often iterative process in any data analysis or data science project. There is no single universally fixed order, as it depends on the specific dataset, but the operations generally follow a logical workflow.

Here is a comprehensive list of data cleaning operations, grouped into logical phases.

---

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment & Discovery
*This phase is about understanding what you're working with before you start changing things.*

1.  **Data Profiling:**
    *   Generate summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, min, max) for numerical fields.
    *   Check for unique value counts and frequency distributions for categorical fields.
    *   Assess the data types of each column (integer, float, string, date, boolean).

2.  **Identify Data Quality Issues:**
    *   **Missing Values:** Identify cells that are null, empty, or contain placeholders (like "N/A", "Unknown", "NULL", 0, -999).
    *   **Inconsistent Formatting:** Spot inconsistencies in text (e.g., "New York" vs. "new york" vs. "NY"), dates ("MM/DD/YYYY" vs. "DD-MM-YYYY"), and phone numbers.
    *   **Structural Errors:** Find typos, strange characters, or incorrect capitalization in categorical data (e.g., "Female," "female," "F").
    *   **Outliers & Anomalies:** Visually (using box plots, scatter plots) or statistically (using Z-scores, IQR) identify values that seem implausible.
    *   **Duplicates:** Look for entirely duplicate rows or duplicate records based on a key identifier (e.g., UserID).

### Phase 2: Core Cleaning Operations
*This is the hands-on phase where you fix the issues you discovered.*

3.  **Handling Missing Data:**
    *   **Deletion:**
        *   Listwise Deletion: Remove entire rows where any value is missing.
        *   Column Deletion: Remove a column if it has a very high percentage of missing values and is not critical.
    *   **Imputation:**
        *   **Numerical Data:** Replace with mean, median, or mode. For time-series data, use forward-fill or backward-fill.
        *   **Categorical Data:** Replace with the mode (most frequent value) or a new category like "Unknown."
        *   **Advanced Imputation:** Use model-based imputation (e.g., K-Nearest Neighbors) to predict missing values.

4.  **Standardizing Formats:**
    *   **Text Data:**
        *   Convert all text to a consistent case (e.g., lower case or title case).
        *   Remove leading/trailing whitespace.
        *   Correct common typos using mapping dictionaries.
    *   **Categorical Data:**
        *   Map inconsistent values to a standard set (e.g., map "F", "female", "Woman" → "Female").
    *   **Date/Time Data:**
        *   Parse all date strings into a consistent `datetime` object.
        *   Extract useful parts (year, month, day, day-of-week) into new columns if needed.
    *   **Numerical Data:**
        *   Standardize units (e.g., convert all currencies to USD, all measurements to metric).

5.  **Handling Duplicates:**
    *   Identify and remove exact duplicate rows.
    *   Identify and handle near-duplicates based on a subset of key columns (e.g., same `First Name`, `Last Name`, and `Email`), deciding which record to keep.

6.  **Correcting Data Types:**
    *   Convert strings that represent numbers to integer/float types.
    *   Convert strings to proper `datetime` objects.
    *   Convert numerical codes that represent categories to a `category` or `object` type.

7.  **Handling Outliers:**
    *   **Investigate:** Determine if the outlier is a valid data point (e.g., a genuinely high-value customer) or an error.
    *   **Actions:**
        *   **Cap/Winsorize:** Set a maximum/minimum threshold and replace values beyond it with the threshold value.
        *   **Transform:** Apply a log transformation to reduce the impact of extreme values.
        *   **Remove:** Delete the record if the outlier is clearly an error (e.g., a person's age of 200).
        *   **Keep:** Leave it in if it's a valid and important piece of information.

### Phase 3: Advanced Cleaning & Transformation
*These operations add value and prepare the data for analysis or modeling.*

8.  **Feature Engineering (often part of cleaning):**
    *   **Parsing:** Split a composite column into multiple columns (e.g., splitting "Full Name" into "First Name" and "Last Name"; splitting an address into street, city, state, zip code).
    *   **Binning/Discretization:** Convert a continuous numerical variable into categorical ranges (e.g., converting "Age" into groups like "0-18", "19-35", "36-55", "55+").
    *   **Creating New Features:** Derive new columns from existing ones (e.g., calculating "Body Mass Index (BMI)" from "Height" and "Weight"; calculating "Days Since Last Purchase" from a date column).

9.  **Data Validation & Enforcing Constraints:**
    *   Ensure data adheres to business rules (e.g., `Age` must be between 0 and 120, `End_Date` must be after `Start_Date`, `Discount` must not exceed `Total_Price`).
    *   Check for referential integrity if dealing with multiple related tables.

10. **Text-Specific Cleaning (for NLP tasks):**
    *   **Tokenization:** Split text into individual words or tokens.
    *   **Removing Stop Words:** Remove common words that don't carry significant meaning (e.g., "the," "a," "an," "in").
    *   **Stemming/Lemmatization:** Reduce words to their root form (e.g., "running" → "run", "better" → "good").
    *   **Removing Punctuation & Special Characters.**
    *   **Handling Encoding Issues** (e.g., fixing mojibake like "Ã©" which should be "é").

### Phase 4: Final Verification & Documentation

11. **Final Quality Check:**
    *   Re-run the data profiling from Phase 1 to confirm all issues have been resolved.
    *   Spot-check random records to ensure the cleaning logic was applied correctly.

12. **Documentation:**
    *   **Crucially, document every cleaning operation performed.**
    *   Record the rationale for decisions (e.g., "Chose to impute missing `Salary` with the median because the distribution was skewed").
    *   This ensures the process is transparent, reproducible, and auditable.
