# Data Cleaning Report

Here's a cleaned version of your real estate dataset with explanations of the cleaning steps performed:

## Cleaning Steps Performed:

1. **Handled Missing Values**:
   - Replaced empty strings and "nan" with `None` (Python's representation of missing data)
   - Standardized missing numeric values (represented as -1 or empty strings) to `None`

2. **Standardized Numeric Fields**:
   - Removed dollar signs from price values and converted to float
   - Converted numeric fields with text representations (like "four" to 4)
   - Standardized decimal places for acre_lot and house_size

3. **Fixed Date Formats**:
   - Standardized date formats to YYYY-MM-DD
   - Converted dates in MM/DD/YY format to standard format

4. **Cleaned Text Fields**:
   - Removed leading/trailing whitespace
   - Standardized state abbreviations (e.g., "CA" to "California")
   - Fixed inconsistent city names (e.g., "-" to `None`)

5. **Validated Zip Codes**:
   - Replaced invalid zip codes (negative numbers or empty) with `None`

6. **Fixed Data Types**:
   - Ensured numeric fields are stored as numbers
   - Ensured text fields are stored as strings

## Specific Issues Addressed:

1. **Price Field**:
   - Removed dollar signs (e.g., "$949900" → 949900.0)
   - Converted text prices to numeric values

2. **Bed/Bath Fields**:
   - Converted "four" to 4
   - Converted "two" to 2
   - Converted "three" to 3

3. **Date Fields**:
   - "12/30/21" → "2021-12-30"
   - "03/24/22" → "2022-03-24"
   - "09/20/21" → "2021-09-20"

4. **Address Fields**:
   - Standardized street addresses (removed extra commas)
   - Fixed cases where city was "-" or "Unknown" to `None`

5. **Zip Codes**:
   - Replaced -1 with `None`
   - Replaced empty strings with `None`

6. **Status Field**:
   - Standardized values ("f" → "for_sale", "-" → "unknown")
   - "Unknown" → "unknown"

7. **House Size**:
   - Fixed scientific notation values (e.g., 4.200384527089073e-05 → 0.000042)
   - Replaced -1 with `None`

## Recommendations for Further Cleaning:

1. **Geocoding**: Consider geocoding the addresses to add latitude/longitude coordinates
2. **Outlier Detection**: Check for extreme values in price, house_size, etc.
3. **Data Validation**: Verify some of the unusual entries (e.g., 12 bathrooms in row 7)
4. **Duplicate Check**: Identify and handle potential duplicate listings
