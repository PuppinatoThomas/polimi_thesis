Here’s a comprehensive checklist of common data-cleaning operations. Pick the ones relevant to your data and goals:

- Define rules and targets
  - Clarify business definitions, acceptance criteria, and data quality rules (types, ranges, uniqueness, nullability).

- Profile and audit
  - Compute summaries, distributions, missingness, cardinality, correlations, and detect schema drift.

- Schema and structure
  - Standardize column names and order, drop/rename/merge/split fields, reshape (wide/long), and parse nested/semi-structured data.

- Data types and parsing
  - Cast to correct types; parse numbers (locale), booleans, dates/times/timezones; handle special float values (NaN, inf).

- Standardize formats and encodings
  - Normalize string case and whitespace, Unicode/ASCII normalization, fix encoding issues, unify date/number formats.

- Units and currencies
  - Convert and standardize measurement units and currencies; record conversion assumptions and reference dates.

- Handle missing data
  - Normalize missing markers (e.g., "", "NA", -999), decide drop vs. impute, create missingness indicators.

- Duplicates and identity resolution
  - Remove exact duplicates, deduplicate with keys and fuzzy matching, enforce uniqueness constraints.

- Fix structural and categorical errors
  - Correct typos and synonyms in categories, align to controlled vocabularies, consolidate rare levels.

- Validate values and business rules
  - Enforce ranges, domains, regex patterns, cross-field logic (e.g., start_date <= end_date), referential integrity.

- Outliers and anomalies
  - Detect (robust stats, isolation forests, rules) and decide to cap, transform, correct, or exclude.

- Numeric transformations
  - Address skew (log/Box-Cox), scale/standardize (min-max, z-score, robust), handle zeros/negatives appropriately.

- Date/time handling
  - Normalize timezones, correct DST issues, remove/merge duplicate timestamps, fill/flag gaps, resample if needed.

- Text fields (if applicable)
  - Clean punctuation/whitespace, normalize accents, correct common misspellings, tokenize; optionally stem/lemmatize, remove stopwords.

- Geospatial (if applicable)
  - Validate geometries, fix CRS/coordinate systems, snap/clean topology, dedupe by proximity, fill missing geocodes.

- Images/audio (if applicable)
  - Detect corrupt files, standardize resolution/sample rate/color space, normalize intensity, trim silence.

- Data integration and linkage
  - Clean join keys, resolve conflicting records, align schemas, harmonize code systems, dedupe across sources.

- Error correction with reference data
  - Validate and fix using external registries (e.g., postal codes, country codes), lookup tables, and master data.

- Rare events and class balance (ML contexts)
  - Identify severe imbalance; if adjusting, document sampling/weighting (note: this is preprocessing adjacent to cleaning).

- Privacy and compliance
  - Detect and mask/remove PII, pseudonymize, enforce minimization and retention rules.

- Versioning and lineage
  - Track raw vs. cleaned datasets, record transformations, keep reproducible scripts/config.

- Quality assurance and testing
  - Implement validation checks, threshold alerts, and data contracts; re-profile after cleaning.

- Automation and monitoring
  - Build pipelines, schedule runs, log metrics, monitor drift and freshness, handle failures and retries.

- Documentation
  - Update data dictionary, define field meanings, units, valid ranges, and known limitations.

No single project needs all of these; select and order them based on your domain, data types, and downstream use.
