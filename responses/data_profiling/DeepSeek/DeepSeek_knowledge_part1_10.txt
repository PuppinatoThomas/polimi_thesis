Of course. Data profiling is the process of examining, analyzing, and summarizing a dataset to understand its structure, content, quality, and relationships. The operations required can be broken down into several key categories.

Here is a comprehensive list of all the operations required to perform data profiling, categorized for clarity.

---

### 1. Column/Field-Level Profiling (Understanding Individual Attributes)

These operations analyze each column in isolation.

*   **Data Type and Format Discovery:**
    *   Identify the physical data type (e.g., `INTEGER`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`).
    *   Infer the logical data type or domain (e.g., Email, Phone Number, ZIP Code, SSN).
    *   Check the format consistency (e.g., `(555) 123-4567` vs. `555.123.4567`).

*   **Completeness & Null Analysis:**
    *   Count and calculate the percentage of `NULL` or empty values.
    *   Identify other placeholders for missing data (e.g., "N/A", "Unknown", "0", "-999").

*   **Cardinality Analysis:**
    *   **Distinct Count:** The number of unique values in a column.
    *   **Unique Check:** Is the column a potential primary key? (Distinct Count = Row Count).
    *   **Selectivity:** The ratio of distinct values to the total number of rows.

*   **Value Distribution & Frequency Analysis:**
    *   Generate a frequency distribution of all values (Top-N and Bottom-N values).
    *   Identify the most common and least common values.

*   **Basic Statistical Summaries (for Numeric Data):**
    *   **Measures of Central Tendency:** Mean, Median, Mode.
    *   **Measures of Dispersion:** Minimum, Maximum, Range, Standard Deviation, Variance.
    *   **Percentiles:** 25th (Q1), 50th (Median), 75th (Q3), 95th, etc.

*   **Pattern & String Length Analysis (for Text Data):**
    *   Identify common patterns (e.g., `AAA-999`, `aaa@bbb.ccc`).
    *   Calculate the minimum, maximum, and average string length.

*   **Domain & Validity Checks:**
    *   Check values against a known list of valid values (e.g., Country Codes, Status Flags).
    *   Identify values that fall outside the expected domain (outliers for categorical data).

### 2. Dataset-Level Profiling (Understanding the Entire Table)

These operations analyze the dataset as a whole.

*   **Volume & Count Analysis:**
    *   Count the total number of rows (record count).
    *   Count the total number of columns (field count).

*   **Uniqueness Analysis:**
    *   Identify duplicate rows across the entire dataset.

*   **Timeliness & Freshness Analysis:**
    *   Check the most recent and oldest dates in date-related fields to understand the data's time range and how up-to-date it is.

---

### 3. Inter-Column and Relationship Profiling (Understanding Dependencies)

These operations analyze the relationships between columns, both within a single table and across different tables.

*   **Foreign Key & Cross-Table Relationship Discovery:**
    *   Identify columns that are potential foreign keys to other tables.
    *   Check for referential integrity violations (e.g., an `Order.CustomerID` with no corresponding `Customer.CustomerID`).

*   **Functional Dependency Discovery:**
    *   Identify if the value in one column determines the value in another (e.g., `Postal Code` -> `City`).

*   **Correlation Analysis (for Numeric Data):**
    *   Calculate correlation coefficients (e.g., Pearson) between numeric columns to identify linear relationships.

*   **Candidate Key Identification:**
    *   Discover which column, or combination of columns, could serve as a unique identifier for a row.

### 4. Data Quality Rule Validation

This is an active check against predefined business rules.

*   **Define and Execute Custom Rules:**
    *   Create rules based on business logic (e.g., "`Discount` must be <= `TotalPrice`", "`StartDate` must be before `EndDate`").
    *   Run these rules and count the number of violations to calculate a "data quality score."

---

### 5. Summary and Reporting

The final step is to synthesize the findings.

*   **Generate a Comprehensive Profile Report:**
    *   This report typically includes the results of all the operations above, often presented as a dashboard or a document with statistics, charts (histograms, frequency bars), and flags for potential issues.
    *   **Data Quality KPIs:** Summarize key metrics like completeness %, uniqueness %, validity %, etc.

### Summary Table of Key Operations

| Category | Operation | Description | Example Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Column-Level** | Data Type & Format | Identifies physical/logical type and pattern. | Type: `STRING`, Format: `Email` |
| | Completeness | Calculates % of non-null values. | Completeness: 95% |
| | Cardinality | Counts distinct and unique values. | Distinct Count: 150, Is Unique: No |
| | Statistics (Numeric) | Calculates min, max, mean, std dev. | Min: 18, Max: 99, Mean: 42.5 |
| | Pattern (Text) | Finds common string patterns. | Top Pattern: `###-##-####` (SSN) |
| **Dataset-Level** | Row & Column Count | Basic volume metrics. | Rows: 1M, Columns: 25 |
| | Duplicate Check | Identifies duplicate records. | Duplicate Rows: 250 |
| **Relationship** | Foreign Key Discovery | Finds potential links to other tables. | `sales.cust_id` -> `customers.id` |
| | Referential Integrity | Checks for orphaned records. | Orphaned Records: 12 |
| | Correlation | Measures relationship between numeric fields. | Correlation (Age, Income): 0.72 |
| **Quality** | Custom Rule Validation | Checks against business rules. | Rule Violations: 45 ("Discount > 100") |

**Note on Automation:** While these operations can be performed manually with SQL and scripts (e.g., `COUNT`, `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY`), they are most effectively executed using specialized data profiling tools (e.g., Informatica Data Quality, Talend, Open-source tools like Great Expectations, Deequ, or integrated features in data warehouses like BigQuery). These tools automate the process and provide rich, interactive reports.
