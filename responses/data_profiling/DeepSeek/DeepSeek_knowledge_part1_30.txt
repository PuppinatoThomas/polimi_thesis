Of course. Data profiling is a systematic process of examining data to understand its structure, content, quality, and relationships. The operations required can be broken down into several key categories.

Here is a comprehensive list of all the operations required to perform data profiling, categorized for clarity.

---

### **1. Structure Discovery (Column/Field Analysis)**
These operations determine the fundamental format and properties of the data.

*   **Data Type Detection:** Identify the inherent data type of each column (e.g., `Integer`, `Float`, `String/Text`, `Date`, `DateTime`, `Boolean`).
*   **Length/Precision Analysis:**
    *   **For Strings:** Find the `min`, `max`, and `average` character length of values.
    *   **For Numerics:** Identify the `precision` (total number of digits) and `scale` (number of digits after the decimal).
*   **Cardinality Analysis:** Determine the number of unique values in a column.
    *   **Distinct Count:** The total number of unique values.
    *   **Unique Percentage:** The ratio of distinct count to total row count.
*   **Nullability Analysis:** Check if a column allows `NULL` (or empty/blank) values.

### **2. Content Discovery (Value Analysis)**
These operations analyze the actual values within the data to understand patterns and distributions.

*   **Statistical Summarization (for Numeric Columns):**
    *   Calculate basic statistics: `Min`, `Max`, `Average (Mean)`, `Median`, `Mode`, `Standard Deviation`.
    *   Calculate percentiles (e.g., 25th, 50th, 75th, 95th, 99th).
*   **Pattern & Format Frequency Analysis (for String Columns):**
    *   Identify and count the frequency of string patterns (e.g., `###-##-####` for SSN, `(###) ###-####` for phone numbers, email patterns).
*   **Top/Bottom Frequency Analysis:**
    *   List the `N` most frequent values and their counts.
    *   List the `N` least frequent values and their counts.
*   **Histogram Creation:** Group values into bins or ranges and count the frequency of records in each bin to visualize the data distribution.

### **3. Data Quality Assessment**
These operations are specifically aimed at identifying data quality issues.

*   **Null/Blank/Empty Count:** Count the absolute number and percentage of missing values.
*   **Data Type Validation:** Check for values that violate the defined or inferred data type (e.g., a string like "N/A" in an integer column).
*   **Domain/Value Set Validation:** Check if values fall within an expected set of valid values (e.g., a "Status" column should only contain 'Active', 'Inactive', 'Pending').
*   **Range & Outlier Detection:**
    *   Identify values outside a defined sensible range (e.g., `Age > 120`).
    *   Use statistical methods (like Z-score or IQR) to detect statistical outliers in numeric fields.
*   **Format & Pattern Compliance:** Identify values that do not conform to a required pattern (e.g., an invalid email address, a malformed date).

### **4. Relationship Discovery (Inter-Table & Intra-Table)**
These operations uncover how data is connected, both within a single table and across multiple tables.

*   **Primary Key/Candidate Key Analysis:** Identify columns (or sets of columns) that have unique values for every row, making them potential primary keys.
*   **Foreign Key & Relationship Discovery:** Discover potential relationships between tables by identifying columns in one table that reference the primary key of another table.
*   **Functional Dependency Discovery:** Determine if the value in one column can be used to determine the value in another column within the same table (e.g., `City` can often determine `State`).
*   **Cross-Table Redundancy/Overlap Analysis:** Check for the same data appearing in multiple tables.

### **5. Metadata & Lineage Analysis**
These operations focus on the data about the data and its origins.

*   **Source System Identification:** Document where the data originated.
*   **Extraction Timestamp Analysis:** Understand the timing and frequency of data updates.
*   **Data Lineage Tracking:** Map how data flows and transforms from its source to its current location.
*   **Schema Consistency Checks:** Compare the profiled schema against documented or expected schema definitions.

### **6. Advanced Profiling Operations**
These are more complex analyses often performed for specific use cases.

*   **Uniqueness Profiling:** Analyze overlapping uniqueness across multiple columns to understand composite keys.
*   **Temporal Analysis:** Analyze how data values change over time (e.g., trends, seasonality).
*   **Data Freshness & Volatility Analysis:** Determine how often data is updated and how much it changes.
*   **Text-Specific Analysis (for free-text fields):**
    *   **Term Frequency:** Identify the most common words or phrases.
    *   **Sentiment Analysis:** Gauge the overall sentiment of text data (positive, negative, neutral).
    *   **Topic Modeling:** Discover abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents.

### **Summary of Key Metrics to Calculate**

In practice, performing the operations above results in generating a set of key metrics for each column. A standard data profiling report often includes:

| Metric | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Column Name** | The name of the profiled column. |
| **Data Type** | The inferred or defined data type. |
| **Total Row Count** | The number of rows in the dataset. |
| **Null Count** & **% Null** | The number and percentage of `NULL`/empty values. |
| **Distinct Count** & **% Unique** | The number and percentage of unique values. |
| **Duplicate Count** & **% Duplicate** | The number and percentage of duplicate values. |
| **Min / Max / Mean / Median** | Key statistical summaries (for numerics and dates). |
| **Standard Deviation** | Measure of data dispersion (for numerics). |
| **Top Frequent Values** | A list of the most common values and their counts. |
| **Pattern/Format Distribution** | A breakdown of values by their string pattern. |
| **Data Quality Issues** | A summary of violations (out-of-range, wrong type, etc.). |

By executing these operations, you move from having raw, unknown data to having a clear, quantified, and documented profile of your data's state, which is the critical first step for any data-centric project.
