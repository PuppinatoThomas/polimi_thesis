High-level data profiling of dataset “Master”

- Domain classification: Residential real estate listings (properties, attributes, and transaction status)
- Shape: 12 columns, 100 rows
- Exact duplicate rows: 0 detected
- Missingness (high level):
  - Common placeholders observed: empty values, nan, -, Unknown, -1, currency symbols mixed into numeric fields (e.g., $949900)
  - Columns with missing or placeholder values: brokered_by, status (has codes f/s/-), price, bed, bath, acre_lot, street, city, state, zip_code, house_size, prev_sold_date
  - Dates use mixed formats (YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YY) and “Unknown”; several blanks
- Type/format inconsistencies:
  - status: values include sold, for_sale, Unknown, f, s, -
  - price: numeric, currency strings ($…), small/implausible (e.g., 2500), and -1 (invalid)
  - bed/bath: numeric plus text (“four”, “two”, “three”, “nan”), and -1
  - acre_lot: negative values (-1), extremely small (e.g., 0.00089, 6.88e-05), very large (e.g., 35.0), and nan
  - state: mixture of full names (California) and abbreviations (CA, TX, OH, NC), blanks, and “Unknown”
  - zip_code: missing, non-5-digit values (e.g., 2831, 1760), blanks
  - house_size: implausible values (e.g., 0.0001057…, 12.0, 85.0, 2025), blanks
  - prev_sold_date: mixed formats, blanks, “Unknown”
- Outliers/invalids (examples):
  - price: -1, 2500, 11400 (likely invalid/special), up to ~2.45M
  - bed: up to 12; bath includes 11/12 and -1; text values present
  - acre_lot: negative values; up to 35+ acres; scientific notation
  - house_size: values that appear to be wrong units or mis-typed (very small decimals, very small integers)
- Near-duplicates/record linkage:
  - Multiple entries appear to refer to the same property with differing details (e.g., same street/city/state/zip with different status, date, or minor attributes)
- Candidate unique key:
  - No reliable single-column key. Candidate composite for property identity: [street, city, state, zip_code]. Consider normalizing address fields and using a standardized geocoded ID.
- Suggested data types (intended, before cleaning):
  - brokered_by: categorical/string (ID-like)
  - status: categorical
  - price: numeric
  - bed, bath: numeric
  - acre_lot: numeric (float)
  - street, city, state, zip_code: string (with standardization needed)
  - house_size: numeric (int)
  - prev_sold_date: date

Overall quality: Mixed; widespread missing/placeholders and type inconsistencies across most columns; requires standardization, parsing, and validation before analysis or modeling.

Consider the Master dataset, perform the single column analysis on it.
Below is a high‑level single‑column profile for the Master dataset. Because the file is large and contains mixed formats in free text (e.g., different date formats, placeholders like “nan”, “-”, currency symbols), exact counts/histograms would require programmatic parsing. This profile summarizes intended types, observed patterns, anomalies, and cleaning recommendations per column.

brokered_by
- Domain classification: Broker/agent identifier for the listing
- Intended datatype: String (ID-like)
- Observed patterns: Numeric IDs; placeholders “nan”, “-1”, and empty
- Issues: Not unique; repeated IDs across multiple listings; placeholder/invalid IDs present
- Cleaning notes: Treat “nan”, empty, “-1” as missing; keep as string to preserve leading zeros if any

status
- Domain classification: Listing status
- Intended datatype: Categorical
- Observed values: sold, for_sale, Unknown, f, s, -
- Issues: Abbreviations (f/s), placeholder “-”, and “Unknown”
- Cleaning notes: Map f→for_sale, s→sold; coalesce “-”/Unknown to a single missing/unknown state

price
- Domain classification: Listing price (USD)
- Intended datatype: Integer/decimal
- Observed patterns: Plain numerics (e.g., 749000), currency strings ($949900, $355000, $90000), small values (e.g., 2500, 11400, 28100), negative sentinel (-1), missing “nan”
- Range examples: min observed -1; max observed ≈ 2,450,000
- Issues: Mixed formats, currency symbols, implausible small values
- Cleaning notes: Strip currency symbols/commas; convert to numeric; flag negatives and very small values for validation

bed
- Domain classification: Bedroom count
- Intended datatype: Integer
- Observed values: Numerics (1–12), text numerals (“four”, “three”), “nan”, empty
- Issues: Mixed numeric/text; missing; occasional very high counts (e.g., 12)
- Cleaning notes: Normalize text numerals to integers; set “nan”/empty to missing; validate plausible range (e.g., 0–10+ per business rules)

bath
- Domain classification: Bathroom count
- Intended datatype: Integer (or float if half-baths are expected)
- Observed values: Numerics (1–12), text (“two”), -1 (sentinel/missing), empty
- Issues: Mixed numeric/text; negative sentinel; high counts
- Cleaning notes: Normalize text numerals; treat -1/empty as missing; decide on half-bath handling and data type

acre_lot
- Domain classification: Lot size in acres
- Intended datatype: Float
- Observed values: Very small decimals (e.g., 0.00089, 0.0066, 6.879878e-05), typical suburban sizes (0.1–1.1), large acreages (e.g., 8.36, 10.0, 14.25, 27.59, 35.0), -1, “nan”, empty
- Issues: Negative sentinel; extremely small values; scientific notation; missing
- Cleaning notes: Convert to float; treat -1/“nan”/empty as missing; validate plausible range

street
- Domain classification: Street address
- Intended datatype: String
- Observed patterns: Standard addresses; quoted values containing commas (“Garden Ct, 614”, “Third Ct, 553”); “Unknown”; empty
- Issues: Embedded commas; some rows lack street; “Unknown” literal used
- Cleaning notes: Preserve quoted strings correctly when parsing CSV; normalize “Unknown”/empty to missing; consider address standardization

city
- Domain classification: City name
- Intended datatype: String
- Observed values: Standard city names; placeholders “-”, “Unknown”
- Issues: Missing placeholders; occasional misalignment with state data in some rows
- Cleaning notes: Normalize placeholders to missing; consider standardization against reference data

state
- Domain classification: State/region
- Intended datatype: String (prefer standardized codes)
- Observed values: Full names (California), postal abbreviations (CA, TX, OH, NC), empty, “Unknown”
- Issues: Mixed representations; missing
- Cleaning notes: Standardize to two-letter postal codes; map “Unknown”/empty to missing

zip_code
- Domain classification: Postal code
- Intended datatype: String (preserve leading zeros)
- Observed patterns: 5-digit zips; short zips (e.g., 2831, 1760); missing blanks; “nan”
- Issues: Inconsistent length; missing; potential loss of leading zeros if treated as numeric
- Cleaning notes: Keep as string; left-pad to 5 digits where applicable; set “nan”/empty to missing

house_size
- Domain classification: Interior size (likely square feet)
- Intended datatype: Integer
- Observed values: Typical values in hundreds/thousands (851, 1409, 3220, 5828); implausible decimals (0.0001057, 4.200384e-05); small integers (12, 85); -1; missing
- Issues: Unit/scale errors; negative sentinel; missing
- Cleaning notes: Treat -1/empty as missing; coerce to integer where plausible; flag extreme/decimal anomalies for review; confirm units

prev_sold_date
- Domain classification: Previous sale date
- Intended datatype: Date
- Observed formats: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., 2021-12-31), MM/DD/YY (e.g., 12/30/21, 03/24/22), textual “Unknown”, empty; earliest seen 1992-10-22, latest seen 2022-10-31
- Issues: Mixed date formats; missing; “Unknown” literal
- Cleaning notes: Parse with multi-format ingestion; standardize to ISO 8601; treat “Unknown”/empty as missing

General notes
- Missingness: Present across most columns, including placeholders such as empty strings, “nan”, “-”, “Unknown”, and sentinel -1.
- Type inconsistencies: Numeric fields with currency symbols, scientific notation, negative sentinels, and textual numerals.
- Outliers: Prices at very low values (e.g., 2,500; 11,400) and negatives; acre_lot negative and very small; house_size decimals and extremely small magnitudes.
- Recommended steps: Define canonical missing-value set; standardize categories (status, state); normalize numerics (strip symbols, cast); validate ranges; standardize addresses (possibly geocode); parse dates to a single format; consider composite key for property identity (e.g., standardized [street, city, state, zip_code]).
