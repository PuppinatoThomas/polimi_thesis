High-level data profiling for dataset “Master”

- Domain classification: Residential real estate listings/transactions (properties for sale or sold)
- Shape: 12 columns, 100 rows
- Exact duplicate rows: 0 observed
- Missingness (high-level): All 12 columns contain missing or placeholder values. Common placeholders include empty string, nan, -, -1, Unknown, and inconsistent encodings (e.g., currency symbols, scientific notation).
- Key/candidate keys:
  - No reliable single-column key (brokered_by is not unique and may be missing or -1).
  - Property-level keys like [street, city, state, zip_code] are not unique due to repeated listings, missing fields, and formatting variations; may need composite keys that include dates or broker/listing identifiers.
- Data type and normalization issues (by column):
  - status: Mixed labels and abbreviations (sold, for_sale, Unknown, -, s, f); needs standardization.
  - price: Numeric values mixed with $-prefixed strings, blanks, nan, and -1; wide range with extreme outliers (e.g., 12,312,100).
  - bed, bath: Integers mixed with words (two, three, four, five), nan, and negative values (e.g., -1); needs coercion to integers and validation.
  - acre_lot: Decimals with negatives (-1), very small scientific-notation values, and large outliers (e.g., 27.59, 14.25); validate non-negative and reasonable ranges.
  - street: Missing and placeholder values (-), inconsistent formats (“Street, number” vs “number Street”); needs address normalization.
  - city/state: Missing/Unknown present; state mixes full names and postal abbreviations; needs standardization to USPS codes.
  - zip_code: Missing, nan, -1, and malformed lengths (e.g., 8830, 2043); needs ZIP validation and padding where appropriate.
  - house_size: Mixed integers/floats with -1 and extremely small scientific-notation values; likely square feet but contains invalid/outlier entries.
  - prev_sold_date: Multiple date formats (YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YY, MM/DD/YYYY), 2-digit years, Unknown, -, and blanks; requires parsing and normalization.
- Consistency/duplicates (non-exact):
  - Many repeated properties (same address) with differing statuses/attributes and address formatting variants (e.g., reordered street/number); indicates near-duplicates and potential multi-record history per property.
- Outliers/anomalies:
  - Very large prices (multi-million) and very small house_size values (scientific notation), negative or implausible values across bed/bath/acre_lot/house_size.
- Recommended next steps (high level):
  - Standardize missing values (treat empty, -, -1, nan, Unknown uniformly as null).
  - Normalize categorical domains (status), numeric coercion (price, bed, bath, acre_lot, house_size), and geographic fields (state to USPS codes, ZIP validation).
  - Unify address formats (parse street/number) to enable de-duplication.
  - Normalize dates to a single ISO format with proper year disambiguation.
  - Define a surrogate ID or composite key and deduplicate near-duplicate property records.

Single-column analysis for dataset “Master”
Assumptions for this pass:
- Treated the following as missing/null: empty string, -, nan/NaN, Unknown, and sentinel values like -1 in numeric fields.
- Coerced numerics by stripping currency symbols ($), parsing spelled numbers (e.g., “two”, “three”), and rejecting invalid/negative values as null.
- Dates parsed to ISO where possible; strings like “Unknown” or blank treated as null.

1) brokered_by
- Domain: Listing/broker identifier
- Datatype (raw → target): String → String
- Missing values: Present (blank, -, nan)
- Distinct values: High (IDs plus placeholders); not unique
- Notes: Contains -1 and blanks; not a reliable key

2) status
- Domain: Listing status
- Datatype (raw → target): String → Categorical
- Missing values: Present (blank, -, Unknown)
- Distinct values: Low–medium
- Common values: sold, for_sale, plus abbreviations (s, f), Unknown, -
- Notes: Requires normalization to a closed set (e.g., {sold, for_sale, off_market, pending})

3) price
- Domain: Listing price (USD)
- Datatype (raw → target): String/Number → Integer
- Missing values: Present (blank, nan, -1 interpreted as null)
- Distinct values: High
- Range (post-cleaning, excluding invalid/sentinels): Min ≈ 22,400; Max ≈ 12,312,100
- Issues: Mixed formats ($-prefixed), -1 placeholders, blanks; large spread and outliers

4) bed
- Domain: Number of bedrooms
- Datatype (raw → target): String/Number → Integer
- Missing values: Present (blank, nan, -1)
- Distinct values: Low–medium
- Range (post-cleaning): Min ≈ 1; Max ≈ 12
- Issues: Spelled numbers (two, three, four, five), negative values (-1), blanks

5) bath
- Domain: Number of bathrooms
- Datatype (raw → target): String/Number → Integer
- Missing values: Present (blank, nan, -1)
- Distinct values: Low–medium
- Range (post-cleaning): Min ≈ 1; Max ≈ 12
- Issues: Spelled numbers, negative and missing placeholders

6) acre_lot
- Domain: Lot size in acres
- Datatype (raw → target): String/Number → Float
- Missing values: Present (blank, nan, -1)
- Distinct values: High
- Range (post-cleaning): Min ≈ 0.00071; Max ≈ 27.59
- Issues: Some negatives/sentinels; very small values that may reflect bad units or parsing

7) street
- Domain: Street address
- Datatype (raw → target): String → String
- Missing values: Present (blank, -)
- Distinct values: High
- Issues: Inconsistent formats (“Name, number” vs “number Name”); some rows with only “-” or blank

8) city
- Domain: City
- Datatype (raw → target): String → String
- Missing values: Present (Unknown, blank)
- Distinct values: High
- Issues: Many Unknowns; some truly missing

9) state
- Domain: State/region
- Datatype (raw → target): String → Categorical (prefer USPS 2-letter codes for US)
- Missing values: Present (Unknown, blank)
- Distinct values: Medium
- Issues: Mixed full names and postal abbreviations (e.g., Texas vs TX), Unknowns

10) zip_code
- Domain: Postal code
- Datatype (raw → target): String/Number → String (ZIP/ZIP+4 without hyphen in raw)
- Missing values: Present (blank, nan, -1)
- Distinct values: High
- Issues: Mixed lengths (e.g., 8830 should be 08830), -1 and blanks; needs zero-padding to 5 digits where applicable

11) house_size
- Domain: Interior size (likely square feet)
- Datatype (raw → target): String/Number → Float/Integer
- Missing values: Present (blank, -1)
- Distinct values: High
- Range (post-cleaning, plausible values): ≈ 87 to 10,440
- Issues: Many implausible tiny scientific-notation values (e.g., 1.15e-05), -1 sentinel, occasional decimals that might be unit or parsing errors; requires rule-based validity checks

12) prev_sold_date
- Domain: Previous sale date
- Datatype (raw → target): String → Date (ISO 8601)
- Missing values: Present (Unknown, -, blank)
- Distinct values: High (dates)
- Formats observed: YYYY-MM-DD, MM/DD/YY, MM/DD/YYYY; some two-digit years; “Unknown”
- Issues: Heterogeneous formats; needs parsing with strict fallback and 2-digit year disambiguation

General recommendations per column
- Standardize missing tokens across all columns to null.
- Normalize categorical domains: status and state (map to controlled vocab/USPS codes).
- Coerce numerics: strip currency symbols, map spelled numbers, null out negatives/sentinels and non-sensical magnitudes.
- Validate ranges:
  - bed ∈ [0, 12] (typical upper bound 10–12)
  - bath ∈ [0, 12]
  - acre_lot ≥ 0 and reasonable (e.g., < 50 for residential; flag larger)
  - house_size ≥ 100 and < 20,000 sq ft for residential; flag outliers
  - price ≥ 0, flag extreme outliers
- Address normalization: parse street number/name to consistent schema; then deduplicate.
- ZIP validation: coerce to 5-digit strings, pad leading zeros, null invalids.
- Dates: normalize to ISO (YYYY-MM-DD), reject invalids, retain original as raw if parsing fails.
