Below is a clear set of wrangling steps and a ready-to-run Pandas recipe that:

- Merges name fields and the prior sale date
- Splits the address into street/city/state
- Formats and converts numeric/date/string columns (incl. padding ZIPs)
- Renames only where it improves clarity
- Drops redundant source columns

What you’ll get in the end
Final columns (and meaning):
- brokered_by: broker ID (int)
- broker_name: merged first + surname (str)
- status: listing status (str, lowercased)
- price_usd: price as numeric USD (int)
- bed: bedrooms (int)
- bath: bathrooms (int)
- lot_acres: lot size in acres (float)
- street_address: street address (str)
- city: city (str)
- state: full state name (str)
- zip: 5-digit ZIP code, zero-padded (str)
- house_sqft: interior size in square feet (int)
- prev_sold_date: ISO date of previous sale (datetime date)

Columns dropped:
- broker_first_name, broker_surname (merged into broker_name)
- address (split)
- currency (all were "$")
- price (replaced by price_usd)
- zip_code (replaced by zip)
- house_size (replaced by house_sqft)
- acre_lot (replaced by lot_acres)
- prev_sold_month, prev_sold_day, prev_sold_year (merged)

Pandas code to perform the wrangling
- Paste your CSV text (including the header) into a file (e.g., listings.csv), then run this.

import pandas as pd

# Read
df = pd.read_csv("listings.csv")

# 1) Merge columns
df["broker_name"] = df["broker_first_name"].str.strip() + " " + df["broker_surname"].str.strip()

# Merge previous sold date (month/day/year) into a single date
df["prev_sold_date"] = pd.to_datetime(
    dict(year=df["prev_sold_year"], month=df["prev_sold_month"], day=df["prev_sold_day"]),
    errors="coerce"
).dt.date  # keep as date (no time)

# 2) Split address into street_address, city, state
# Address format: "street, city, State"
addr = df["address"].str.extract(r"^(.*?),\s*(.*?),\s*([A-Za-z ]+)$")
addr.columns = ["street_address", "city", "state"]
df = pd.concat([df, addr], axis=1)

# 3) Format/convert columns
# Price to numeric and make it explicit USD
df["price_usd"] = pd.to_numeric(df["price"], errors="coerce").astype("Int64")

# Standardize types for bedrooms/bathrooms/lot size/house size
df["bed"] = pd.to_numeric(df["bed"], errors="coerce").astype("Int64")
df["bath"] = pd.to_numeric(df["bath"], errors="coerce").astype("Int64")
df["lot_acres"] = pd.to_numeric(df["acre_lot"], errors="coerce")
df["house_sqft"] = pd.to_numeric(df["house_size"], errors="coerce").astype("Int64")

# ZIP: to 5-digit zero-padded string
df["zip"] = df["zip_code"].astype(str).str.zfill(5)

# Status: keep consistent lower case
df["status"] = df["status"].str.lower().str.strip()

# 4) Rename only where it improves clarity (done above in new columns)
# price -> price_usd; acre_lot -> lot_acres; house_size -> house_sqft; zip_code -> zip

# 5) Drop now-redundant source columns
cols_to_drop = [
    "broker_first_name", "broker_surname",
    "currency",
    "address",
    "price",
    "zip_code",
    "house_size",
    "acre_lot",
    "prev_sold_month", "prev_sold_day", "prev_sold_year"
]
df = df.drop(columns=cols_to_drop)

# Reorder columns for readability
final_cols = [
    "brokered_by", "broker_name", "status", "price_usd",
    "bed", "bath", "lot_acres",
    "street_address", "city", "state", "zip",
    "house_sqft", "prev_sold_date"
]
df = df[final_cols]

# Optional: save to a new CSV
df.to_csv("listings_wrangled.csv", index=False)

Notes and checks
- ZIP codes like 1262 will be padded to 01262, which is the correct 5-digit format.
- Currency column was dropped after converting price to price_usd (all currency symbols were $).
- If any address rows deviate from the "street, city, State" pattern, they will yield NaNs in the split columns. The given data matches the pattern.
- prev_sold_date uses ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD). If any component is invalid, it becomes NaT/NaN date.
