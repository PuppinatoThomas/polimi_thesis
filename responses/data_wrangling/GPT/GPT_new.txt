Absolutely! We can wrangle this dataset into a cleaner, analysis-ready format. Let’s go step by step with what we can do:

### Issues in the Dataset

1. **Column consistency**

   * `price` and `currency` are separated, but `currency` is always `$` → can merge into one numeric column.
   * Dates (`prev_sold_month`, `prev_sold_day`, `prev_sold_year`) are split → should be combined into a single `prev_sold_date`.

2. **Data types**

   * `price`, `bed`, `bath`, `acre_lot`, `house_size`, and `zip_code` should be numeric.
   * `status` should be categorical (`sold`, `for_sale`).
   * `address` is a text field but could be split into `street`, `city`, `state`.

3. **Duplicates**

   * Some `brokered_by` values repeat (e.g., `22611` shows up for Helen Anderson and Charlotte Garcia).
   * Possible duplicate houses with different brokers.

4. **Missing or inconsistent values**

   * Some properties lack `prev_sold_date` (e.g., listings from the 1990s/2000s look like old sales).
   * Acreage and house size vary wildly → need normalization or flagging outliers.

### Wrangling Steps

Here’s what I’d do in **Python (pandas)**:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load data
df = pd.read_csv("real_estate.csv")

# 1. Merge price and currency into numeric 'price_usd'
df['price_usd'] = df['price'].replace('[\$,]', '', regex=True).astype(float)

# 2. Combine date columns into one datetime column
df['prev_sold_date'] = pd.to_datetime(
    df[['prev_sold_year', 'prev_sold_month', 'prev_sold_day']],
    errors='coerce'
)

# 3. Ensure numeric fields are proper types
numeric_cols = ['bed', 'bath', 'acre_lot', 'house_size', 'zip_code']
df[numeric_cols] = df[numeric_cols].apply(pd.to_numeric, errors='coerce')

# 4. Split address into components
df[['street', 'city', 'state']] = df['address'].str.extract(r'^(.*),\s*(.*),\s*([A-Za-z\s]+)$')

# 5. Remove duplicates
df = df.drop_duplicates()

# 6. Handle outliers (example: flag lot sizes > 10 acres)
df['large_lot_flag'] = df['acre_lot'] > 10

# 7. Drop unnecessary columns
df = df.drop(columns=['price', 'currency', 'prev_sold_year', 'prev_sold_month', 'prev_sold_day'])

# Final cleaned dataframe
print(df.head())
```

### After Wrangling, You’ll Have

* `brokered_by, broker_first_name, broker_surname, status, price_usd, bed, bath, acre_lot, house_size, address, street, city, state, zip_code, prev_sold_date, large_lot_flag`
* All numeric fields cleaned, dates unified, addresses parsed, and duplicates handled.

Would you like me to **run this cleaning on the dataset you shared** and show you the cleaned dataframe (so you can see exactly what it looks like), or should I just give you the full cleaned CSV file as output?
