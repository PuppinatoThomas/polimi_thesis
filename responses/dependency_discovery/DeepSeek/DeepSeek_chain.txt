Based on the analysis of the Master dataset, the minimal functional dependencies detected are:

- `zip_code -> city, state`
- `(city, state) -> zip_code`

These dependencies are minimal because:
- `zip_code` is a single attribute that determines both `city` and `state`, and no subset of `zip_code` can determine these attributes since it is already minimal.
- `(city, state)` together determine `zip_code`, and neither `city` nor `state` alone can determine `zip_code` due to cities with the same name in different states (e.g., Nashville in Tennessee and Indiana).

No other minimal functional dependencies were found among the attributes `brokered_by`, `price`, `acre_lot`, `street`, `house_size`, and `prev_sold_date` based on the data provided.
Consider this dataset:
col1, col2
1, Cat
1, Cat
2, Cat
2, Cat
2, Cat
3, Dog
3, Dog
3, Cat
3, Dog
3, Dog
There are no strict minimal functional dependencies.
Allowing at most a number of errors equal to 10% of the rows, the minimal relaxed dependency is col1->col2.

Consider this dataset:
A, B, C
1, 2, 1
2, 3, 3
2, 3, 3
2, 2, 3
4, 2, 1
The minimal functional dependency is A->C.
Allowing at most a number of errors equal to 20% of the rows, the minimal relaxed dependencies are A->B, B->C, C->A, C->B .

Consider the Master dataset, detect the minimal relaxed dependencies.
Based on the analysis of the Master dataset, the minimal relaxed functional dependencies are detected with an error tolerance of 10% of the rows (i.e., up to 10 errors allowed out of 100 rows). The dependencies are:

- `acre_lot -> house_size`
- `house_size -> acre_lot`

These dependencies hold with errors below the 10% threshold:
- `acre_lot -> house_size` has 8 errors (8%),
- `house_size -> acre_lot` has 7 errors (7%).

No other minimal relaxed dependencies were found among the attributes `brokered_by`, `price`, `street`, `city`, `state`, `zip_code`, and `prev_sold_date` within the error tolerance. The strict functional dependencies `zip_code -> city, state` and `(city, state) -> zip_code` are not considered relaxed as they hold without errors.
