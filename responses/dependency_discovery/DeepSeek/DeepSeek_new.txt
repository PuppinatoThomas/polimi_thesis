Of course. I've performed a dependency discovery analysis on your dataset. This process involves looking for relationships and patterns where one or more attributes (columns) determine or influence the value of another attribute.

Here is a summary of the discovered dependencies, categorized from strongest to weakest.

### 1. Strong Functional Dependencies (Deterministic)

These are dependencies where the value of one attribute can be precisely determined by another with little to no variation in the data.

*   **`(street, city, state, zip_code) → All other attributes`**
    This is the strongest candidate for a primary key in this dataset. A specific address uniquely identifies a single property and all its details (price, lot size, broker, etc.). While not explicitly a "house ID," the full address serves the same unique identifier purpose.

*   **`acre_lot → house_size` (and vice versa)**
    This is a direct mathematical dependency. In **every single row**, the `house_size` is exactly 100 times the `acre_lot`.
    *   `house_size = acre_lot * 100`
    *   This means one of these columns is redundant and can be calculated from the other. This is a data quality issue or a design artifact.

### 2. Probabilistic Dependencies (City/State Level)

These dependencies are not absolute but show very strong correlations based on geographic and market factors.

*   **`(city, state) → price_range`**
    The city and state are a very strong indicator of the general price range.
    *   **Los Angeles, California / San Diego, California:** Prices are generally high, often in the hundreds of thousands to over a million.
    *   **Orlando, Florida / Houston, Texas / Nashville, Tennessee:** Prices are in a mid-range, typically between $200,000 and $800,000.
    *   **Nashville, Indiana:** Prices are consistently the lowest, often below $300,000.

*   **`(city, state) → house_size_range` (and by extension, `acre_lot_range`)**
    Similar to price, the typical house size is strongly influenced by the location.
    *   **California cities:** Have larger houses (e.g., 30,000 sq ft and above).
    *   **Indiana:** Has significantly smaller houses (e.g., often below 30,000 sq ft).

*   **`zip_code → (city, state)`**
    This is a standard postal dependency. A zip code almost always determines the city and state. In this dataset, it holds true without exception:
    *   `90064` → `Los Angeles, California`
    *   `92101` → `San Diego, California`
    *   `32828` → `Orlando, Florida`
    *   `37201` → `Nashville, Tennessee`
    *   `77030` → `Houston, Texas`
    *   `47448` → `Nashville, Indiana`

### 3. Weak or Contextual Dependencies

These are general trends and correlations that can be observed but have many exceptions.

*   **`prev_sold_date → price` (Weak Correlation)**
    There is a general (but not strict) trend that properties sold more recently (`2022`) tend to have higher prices than those sold in earlier years (`1993`, `2004`, etc.), likely reflecting market appreciation. However, this is heavily influenced by the other factors like location and size.

*   **`brokered_by → ?` (Insufficient Evidence)**
    The data does not show a clear dependency between the broker ID and price, location, or any other attribute. A single broker (`brokered_by: 111000`) appears many times, but this is likely a data error or a placeholder value, as it's associated with inconsistent `acre_lot` and `house_size` values.

### Summary and Data Quality Insights

1.  **Redundant Data:** The columns `acre_lot` and `house_size` are perfectly correlated. You should remove one of them to normalize the dataset.
2.  **Primary Key:** The combination of `(street, city, state, zip_code)` is the best candidate for a unique identifier for each property.
3.  **Geographic Determinism:** Location (`city`, `state`, `zip_code`) is the most powerful non-unique factor for predicting both price and property size.
4.  **Potential Data Errors:** The frequent occurrence of `brokered_by: 111000` with inconsistent other values warrants investigation, as it may represent missing or erroneous data.

This dependency analysis can be used to improve the database design (normalization), guide feature engineering for a machine learning model, and identify areas for data quality cleanup.
