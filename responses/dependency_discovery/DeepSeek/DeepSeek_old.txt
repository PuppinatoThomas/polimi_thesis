# Dependency Discovery in the Real Estate Dataset

After analyzing the dataset, I've identified several potential dependencies and relationships between the variables:

## Strong Dependencies (Likely Direct Relationships)

1. **Price vs. House Size**: There appears to be a strong positive correlation between price and house_size (square footage). Larger homes generally command higher prices.

2. **Price vs. Location**: The state and city variables significantly impact price, with properties in certain states (California, Massachusetts, Virginia) consistently having higher prices than others.

3. **Bed/Bath Count vs. House Size**: The number of bedrooms and bathrooms tends to increase with larger house sizes.

4. **Status vs. Prev_Sold_Date**: Properties marked as "sold" typically have more recent prev_sold_date values than those "for_sale".

## Moderate Dependencies (Potential Relationships)

1. **Price vs. Acre_Lot**: While there's some relationship, it's not perfectly linear - very large lots (especially in rural areas) don't always correlate with higher prices.

2. **Price vs. Bed/Bath Count**: More bedrooms/bathrooms generally mean higher prices, but this is heavily modified by location and house size.

3. **City vs. State**: Each city is dependent on its state (deterministic relationship).

## Weak or No Clear Dependencies

1. **Brokered_by vs. Other Variables**: The broker ID doesn't show any clear patterns with other variables.

2. **Zip_Code vs. Other Variables**: While zip codes relate to location, they don't show clear patterns beyond what's captured by city/state.

3. **Street Address vs. Other Variables**: The specific street address doesn't show meaningful patterns.

## Interesting Observations

1. **California Premium**: Properties in California consistently command higher prices regardless of other factors.

2. **Date Patterns**: Most "sold" properties were transacted in late 2021 through early 2022, while "for_sale" properties have older prev_sold_dates.

3. **Urban vs. Rural**: Small urban lots often have higher prices per square foot than larger rural properties.

4. **Bathroom Anomalies**: Some properties have more bathrooms than bedrooms (e.g., 3 beds/4 baths), which may indicate luxury properties.

Would you like me to perform any specific statistical tests or visualizations to quantify these relationships further?
