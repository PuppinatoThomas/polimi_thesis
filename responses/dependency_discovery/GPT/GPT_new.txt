Looking at this real estate dataset, I can perform dependency discovery by analyzing relationships between attributes. Here are the key dependencies and patterns I've identified:

## Strong Dependencies (Functional Dependencies)

**1. Geographic Dependencies:**
- `zip_code` → `city`, `state`
- `city`, `state` → `zip_code` (many-to-one relationship)

**2. Property Characteristic Dependencies:**
- `brokered_by`, `street`, `city`, `state` → `price`, `acre_lot`, `house_size` (unique property identification)
- `house_size` ≈ `acre_lot × 1000` (for most records, with some exceptions)

**3. Location-based Price Patterns:**
- `city`, `state` influences `price` ranges significantly
- Los Angeles properties generally higher priced than other locations

## Partial Dependencies

**1. Multi-valued Dependencies:**
- `city` → multiple `zip_code` values (e.g., Los Angeles has 90033, 90064)
- `state` → multiple `city` values (e.g., California has Los Angeles, San Diego)

**2. Transitive Dependencies:**
- `street`, `city`, `state` → `zip_code` → `city`, `state` (redundant)
- `prev_sold_date` and `price` show temporal dependencies

## Data Quality Issues Discovered

**1. Inconsistent Data Patterns:**
- Some `house_size` values don't follow the `acre_lot × 1000` pattern (e.g., rows with small acre_lot but normal house_size)
- Mixed date formats in `prev_sold_date`
- Some `acre_lot` values have excessive decimal precision

**2. Potential Data Entry Errors:**
- Property at 71 Hill Ln, Los Angeles: acre_lot = 0.18 but house_size = 2344 (unusual ratio)
- Several properties with very small acre_lot values (< 1 acre) but normal house sizes

## Business Logic Dependencies

**1. Market-based Rules:**
- Higher `acre_lot` generally correlates with higher `price`
- Recent `prev_sold_date` (2022) often indicates current market pricing
- Location (`city`, `state`) strongly influences price per square foot

**2. Broker Patterns:**
- Some brokers appear to specialize in specific geographic areas
- Price ranges vary by broker specialization

## Recommended Normalization

This dataset would benefit from:
1. **Separate location table** with `zip_code`, `city`, `state`
2. **Property table** with core attributes
3. **Transaction history table** for `prev_sold_date` and price history
4. **Broker reference table**

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these dependencies or suggest specific data cleaning approaches?
