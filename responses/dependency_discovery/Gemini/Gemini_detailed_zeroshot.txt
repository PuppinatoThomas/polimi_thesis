Okay, let's perform dependency discovery on the provided dataset.

**Understanding the Data**

First, let's reiterate the column names and their likely data types:

*   `brokered_by`: Integer (likely an agent ID)
*   `price`: Integer (price of the property)
*   `acre_lot`: Float (size of the lot in acres)
*   `street`: String (street address)
*   `city`: String (city name)
*   `state`: String (state name)
*   `zip_code`: Integer (zip code)
*   `house_size`: Integer (size of the house, likely in square feet)
*   `prev_sold_date`: Date (date the property was previously sold)

**1. Minimal Functional Dependencies Discovery (Strict)**

Functional dependencies (FDs) state that if two rows have the same value for attribute(s) A, then they must also have the same value for attribute(s) B.  We're looking for *minimal* FDs, meaning the left-hand side (determinant) is as small as possible.

Based on the nature of the data, here are some potential strict FDs that *might* hold (but we need to verify):

*   **`zip_code` -> `city`, `state`**:  A zip code should uniquely determine the city and state.
*   **`street`, `city`, `state` -> `zip_code`**: A street address, city, and state should uniquely determine the zip code.
*   **`street`, `city`, `state` -> `price`**: A street address, city, and state might uniquely determine the price.

Let's verify these against the data.

*   **`zip_code` -> `city`, `state`**:
    *   `90064` -> `Los Angeles`, `California` (Consistent)
    *   `92101` -> `San Diego`, `California` (Consistent)
    *   `47448` -> `Nashville`, `Indiana` (Consistent)
    *   `32828` -> `Orlando`, `Florida` (Consistent)
    *   `37201` -> `Nashville`, `Tennessee` (Consistent)
    *   `77030` -> `Houston`, `Texas` (Consistent)
    This FD holds.

    *   `249 South Pl,Los Angeles,California` -> `90064` (Consistent)
    This FD holds.

*   **`street`, `city`, `state` -> `price`**: This FD does not hold.  The same address can have different prices over time or due to different conditions of the property.

**Therefore, the strict functional dependencies are:**

*   **`zip_code` -> `city`, `state`**
*   **`street`, `city`, `state` -> `zip_code`**

**2. Minimal Relaxed Dependencies Discovery**

Now, let's look for dependencies that hold with some relaxation.  This means we'll allow for some tolerance in the values.

*   **`acre_lot` -> `price` (with tolerance)**:  We might expect that larger lots generally correspond to higher prices.  However, this won't be a strict FD because location, house size, and other factors also influence price.  We can check the correlation between `acre_lot` and `price`.

*   **`house_size` -> `price` (with tolerance)**:  Larger houses generally cost more.  Again, this is not a strict FD.  We can check the correlation between `house_size` and `price`.

*   **`city`, `state` -> `average_price` (with tolerance)**:  We might expect that certain cities/states have generally higher or lower average prices.

*   **`prev_sold_date` -> `price` (with tolerance)**: We might expect that the price increases over time.

Let's analyze these:

*   **`acre_lot` -> `price` (with tolerance)**:  Visually inspecting the data, there's a general trend that larger `acre_lot` values tend to have higher `price` values, but there's a lot of scatter.  A correlation coefficient would be helpful here.  We can't definitively say this holds strongly without calculating the correlation.

*   **`house_size` -> `price` (with tolerance)**:  Similar to `acre_lot`, there's a general trend that larger `house_size` values tend to have higher `price` values, but there's a lot of scatter.  A correlation coefficient would be helpful here.  We can't definitively say this holds strongly without calculating the correlation.

*   **`city`, `state` -> `average_price` (with tolerance)**:
    *   Los Angeles, California: Prices range from $111,000 to $2,199,000
    *   San Diego, California: Prices range from $69,900 to $525,000
    *   Nashville, Indiana: Prices range from $111,000 to $1,150,000
    *   Orlando, Florida: Prices range from $90,000 to $1,979,000
    *   Nashville, Tennessee: Prices range from $105,000 to $2,450,000
    *   Houston, Texas: Prices range from $111,000 to $1,110,000
    This holds to some extent.  Los Angeles and San Diego tend to have higher prices than Nashville, Indiana.

*   **`prev_sold_date` -> `price` (with tolerance)**:  It's difficult to assess this without more sophisticated time series analysis.  We'd need to normalize prices for inflation and other market factors.  A simple visual inspection doesn't reveal a clear trend.

**Relaxed Dependencies Summary:**

*   **`acre_lot` -> `price` (weak, needs correlation analysis)**
*   **`house_size` -> `price` (weak, needs correlation analysis)**
*   **`city`, `state` -> `average_price` (moderate, some cities tend to have higher prices)**

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data Size:** This dataset is relatively small.  More data would give us more confidence in our findings.
*   **Domain Knowledge:**  Real estate is complex.  Factors like school districts, amenities, and market conditions significantly impact prices.  We're only looking at a few basic attributes.
*   **Correlation vs. Causation:**  Even if we find strong correlations, it doesn't mean there's a causal relationship.  There could be confounding variables.
*   **Data Cleaning:**  There are some inconsistencies in the data (e.g., `acre_lot` values with many decimal places).  Cleaning the data could improve the accuracy of our analysis.

**Next Steps (for Relaxed Dependencies):**

1.  **Calculate Correlation Coefficients:**  Compute the Pearson correlation coefficient between `acre_lot` and `price`, and between `house_size` and `price`.  This will give us a quantitative measure of the strength of the linear relationship.
2.  **Visualize Data:** Create scatter plots of `acre_lot` vs. `price` and `house_size` vs. `price`.  This will help us visually assess the relationships and identify any outliers.
3.  **Statistical Significance:**  Determine if the correlations are statistically significant.
4.  **More Sophisticated Analysis:**  Consider using regression analysis to model the relationship between `price` and multiple independent variables (e.g., `acre_lot`, `house_size`, `city`, `state`).

In summary, we've identified some strict functional dependencies and some potential relaxed dependencies. Further analysis is needed to quantify the strength of the relaxed dependencies.
