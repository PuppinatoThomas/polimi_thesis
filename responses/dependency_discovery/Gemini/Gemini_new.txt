Okay, I've analyzed the dataset and here's a breakdown of potential dependencies and relationships between the columns.  Keep in mind that these are based on the *observed* data and might not represent true, causal dependencies in the real world.  Also, the limited size of the dataset means some potential dependencies might not be apparent.

**Column Descriptions (for context):**

*   `brokered_by`:  Likely an ID for the real estate broker or agency.
*   `price`:  The selling price of the property.
*   `acre_lot`:  The size of the property's lot in acres.
*   `street`:  The street address of the property.
*   `city`:  The city where the property is located.
*   `state`:  The state where the property is located.
*   `zip_code`:  The zip code of the property.
*   `house_size`:  The size of the house in some unit (likely square feet).
*   `prev_sold_date`:  The date the property was last sold.

**Potential Dependencies:**

1.  **`zip_code`  ->  `city`,  `state`:**  This is a very strong dependency.  A zip code uniquely identifies a city and state.  There might be rare exceptions where a zip code spans multiple small towns, but in this dataset, it's likely a deterministic dependency.

2.  **`city`, `state` -> `zip_code`:** This is not a strong dependency. There are multiple zip codes in each city.

3.  **`street`, `city`, `state` -> `zip_code`:** This is a strong dependency. A street address, city, and state uniquely identify a zip code.

4.  **`acre_lot` -> `price`:** There is a positive correlation between `acre_lot` and `price`. Larger lots tend to be more expensive, but this is not a strict dependency. Other factors influence price.

5.  **`house_size` -> `price`:** There is a positive correlation between `house_size` and `price`. Larger houses tend to be more expensive, but this is not a strict dependency. Other factors influence price.

6.  **`city`, `house_size` -> `price`:** The combination of city and house size might give a better indication of price than either alone, due to varying market conditions in different cities.

7.  **`city`, `acre_lot` -> `price`:** The combination of city and lot size might give a better indication of price than either alone, due to varying market conditions in different cities.

8.  **`prev_sold_date` -> `price`:**  The `prev_sold_date` might influence the `price`.  Properties sold more recently might reflect current market values.  However, this is a weak dependency as many other factors are involved.

9.  **`street` -> `house_size`, `acre_lot`, `price`:**  The street address itself doesn't *determine* these values, but properties on the same street might have similar characteristics due to zoning regulations, neighborhood development, etc.  This is a very weak dependency.

10. **`brokered_by` -> `price`, `city`, `state`:** There is no dependency.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Data Quality:**  The dataset has some inconsistencies (e.g., `acre_lot` values with excessive decimal places).  Data cleaning would improve the accuracy of dependency discovery.
*   **Domain Knowledge:**  Real estate pricing is complex.  Factors not included in this dataset (e.g., number of bedrooms/bathrooms, condition of the property, school district, proximity to amenities) significantly influence price.
*   **Causation vs. Correlation:**  Dependency discovery identifies correlations.  It doesn't prove causation.  For example, a larger house *might* cause a higher price, but it's also possible that people who can afford higher prices choose to buy larger houses.
*   **Functional Dependencies vs. Statistical Dependencies:**  I've focused on potential functional dependencies (where one column *determines* another) and statistical dependencies (where columns are correlated).

**In summary:**

The strongest dependencies are related to location (`zip_code`, `city`, `state`).  `price` is influenced by `acre_lot`, `house_size`, and location, but it's not strictly determined by them.  A larger, more comprehensive dataset with more features would be needed for more robust dependency discovery.
